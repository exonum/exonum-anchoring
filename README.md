# Exonum Anchoring Service to Bitcoin

[![Build Status][travis:image]][travis:url]

This crate implements a service for [Exonum] blockchain that provides
a protocol for anchoring onto the Bitcoin blockchain that utilizes the
native Bitcoin capabilities of creating multisig transactions.

* [Reference documentation][exonum:reference]
* [Specification][anchoring:specification]
* [Example code](examples/btc_anchoring.rs)
* [Deployment guide](#deployment)
* [Contribution guide][exonum:contribution]

## Prerequisites

### Installation

Just follow [Exonum][exonum:install] installation guide to install dependencies.

### Bitcoin Node Deployment

First of all install `bitcoind` via your package manager and ensure that you
use the latest stable version. You may visit official Bitcoin [site][bitcoin:install]
for more information about installation.

Then create `bitcoind` configuration file according to this [tutorial][bitcoin_wiki:configuration].

For correct work of the service, the `bitcoind` configuration file
should contain the following settings:

```ini
# Run the node in the test network instead of the real Bitcoin network.
# If you want to use the main network comment the line bellow:
testnet=1
# server=1 tells `Bitcoin-Qt` and `bitcoind` to accept JSON-RPC commands.
server=1
# Maintain a full transaction index, used by the `getrawtransaction` RPC call.
# An arbitrary `bitcoind` daemon is not required to respond to a request for
# information about an arbitrary transaction, thus you should uncomment the
# line bellow if you want to use the daemon in an existing Exonum network.
# txindex=1

# Bind to the given address to listen to JSON-RPC connections.
# Use [host]:port notation for IPv6.
# This option can be specified multiple times (default: bind to all interfaces)
#rpcbind=<addr>
# You must specify `rpcuser` and `rpcpassword` to secure the JSON-RPC API
#rpcuser=<username>
#rpcpassword=YourSuperGreatPasswordNumber_DO_NOT_USE_THIS_OR_YOU_WILL_GET_ROBBED_385593
```

These RPC settings will be used by the service.

After creating configuration file, launch `bitcoind` daemon via command:

```shell
bitcoind --daemon
```

***Note!** Downloading and indexing of the Bitcoin blockchain may take a lot of time,
especially for the mainnet.*

## Usage

Include `exonum-btc-anchoring` as a dependency into your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
exonum-btc-anchoring = "0.10"
```

Add the BTC anchoring service to the blockchain in the main project file:

```rust
extern crate exonum;
extern crate exonum_btc_anchoring as anchoring;

use exonum::helpers;
use exonum::helpers::fabric::NodeBuilder;

fn main() {
    exonum::crypto::init();
    helpers::init_logger().unwrap();
    let node = NodeBuilder::new()
        .with_service(Box::new(anchoring::ServiceFactory));
    node.run();
}

```

## Configuration Parameters

### For the `generate-template` subcommand

* `btc-anchoring-network` - Bitcoin network type used for downloading Bitcoin blocks headers.

  Possible values: [mainnet, testnet, regtest]

* `btc-anchoring-interval` - interval in blocks between anchored blocks.
* `btc-anchoring-fee` - transaction fee per byte in satoshis that anchoring nodes should use.
* `btc-anchoring-utxo-confirmations` - the minimum number of confirmations for the first funding transaction.

### For the `generate-config` subcommand

* `btc-anchoring-rpc-host` - Bitcoin RPC URL.
* `btc-anchoring-rpc-user` - User to login into `bitcoind`.
* `btc-anchoring-rpc-password` - Password to login into `bitcoind`.

### For the `finalize` subcommand

* `btc-anchoring-create-funding-tx` - if this option is set, the node will create an initial
  funding transaction with the given amount in satoshis and return its identifier.
* `btc-anchoring-funding-txid` - identifier of the initial funding transaction which was created
  previously using the option above.

### For adjusting the running blockchain configuration

Variables that you can modify

* `transaction_fee` - the amount of the fee per byte in satoshis for anchoring transactions.
* `anchoring_interval` - the interval in blocks between anchored blocks.
* `funding_transaction` - the hex representation of the current funding transaction,
  the node will use it as an input if it is not spent.
* `public_keys` - the list of the hex-encoded compressed Bitcoin public keys of the
  Exonum validators that form a redeem script. The script is transformed into the
  anchoring address.

***Warning!** The `network` parameter shouldn't be changed otherwise the service will come to a halt.*

## Deployment

### Example of the Anchoring Service Installation

For the fast anchoring demonstration you can use a built-in anchoring example.

```bash
cargo install --example btc_anchoring
```

For example, create a BTC anchoring configuration template for the testnet Bitcoin network.
In our case we create a template for the network with several validators.

```bash
btc_anchoring generate-template template.toml \
    --validators-count 2 \
    --btc-anchoring-network testnet \
    --btc-anchoring-fee 100 \
    --btc-anchoring-utxo-confirmations 0
```

Each node generates its own public and secret node configuration files.

```bash
btc_anchoring generate-config template.toml pub/0.toml sec/0.toml \
    --peer-address 127.0.0.0:7000 \
    --btc-anchoring-rpc-host http://localhost:18332 \
    --btc-anchoring-rpc-user user \
    --btc-anchoring-rpc-password password
```

Participants need to send some bitcoins to the anchoring address in order to enable
Bitcoin anchoring. For this:

* One of the nodes generates initial `funding_transaction` by the finalize command:

  ```bash
  btc_anchoring finalize sec/0.toml nodes/0.toml \
      --public-configs pub/0.toml pub/1.toml
      --btc-anchoring-create-funding-tx 100000000
  ```

  This command generates configuration of the node and returns transaction
  identifier of the generated `funding_transaction`.

  ***Note!** `bitcoind` node should have a certain amount of Bitcoins, since the initial funding
  transaction will be created during the Exonum network generation.
  For the testnet you may use a [`faucet`][bitcoin:faucet] to get some coins.*

* While others should use this transaction identifier:

  ```bash
  btc_anchoring finalize sec/0.toml nodes/0.toml \
      --public-configs pub/0.toml pub/1.toml \
      --btc-anchoring-funding-txid 73f5f6797bedd4b1024805bc6d7e08e5206a5597f97fd8a47ed7ad5a5bb174ae
  ```

  ***Important note!** The funding transaction should have a sufficient number of confirmations.
  Said number is set in advance by the `btc-anchoring-utxo-confirmations` parameter.*

### Launch Node

Launch all the Exonum nodes in the given Exonum network. To launch a particular node just execute:

```bash
btc_anchoring run --node-config <destdir>/<N>.toml --db-path <destdir>/db/<N>
```

If you want to see additional information you may specify the log level by an environment
variable `RUST_LOG="exonum_btc_anchoring=info"`.

## Maintenance

As a maintainer you can perform the following actions.

### Modify Configuration Parameters

You can safely change the following parameters: `transaction_fee` and `anchoring_interval`.

### Add Funds

Send some Bitcoins to the current anchoring [wallet][exonum:actual_address] and save a raw
transaction body hex.
Wait until transaction gets enough confirmations. Then replace the `funding_tx` variable by the
saved hex.

***Note!** If the current anchoring chain [becomes unusable][exonum:change_address],
you may start a new chain by adding a corresponding funding transaction.*

### Modify List of Validators

***Important warning!*** After change of the validators list the anchoring address also changes,
thus, there is no possibility to sign anchoring transactions addressed to the old anchoring address.

So please make sure that:

* The current anchoring wallet has enough coins to create an anchoring transaction
  to a new address.
* Difference between the activation height (`actual_from`) and the
  current Exonum blockchain height is sufficient to sign an anchoring transaction.

And then perform the following steps:

* If necessary, generate a new key pair for anchoring.
* Change the list of validators via editing `public_keys` array.
* Initiate the configuration update procedure.
* Make sure that the configuration update procedure is not delayed. That is, do not delay
  the voting procedure for a new configuration.
* Look at a new [address][exonum:following_address] of the anchoring.
* Modify anchoring private keys.

  Each Exonum node stores a map for the anchoring address and its corresponding private key
  in the local configuration.

  The address is encoded using [`bech32`][bitcoin:bech32] encoding and the private key uses
  [`WIF`][bitcoin:wif] format.

  ```ini
  [[services_configs.btc_anchoring.local.private_keys]]
  address = "tb1q65fdqxzzd8sfjdjnmanf3agg5np9yz8fn33znmjgt9lm2m0chw8slahxwf"
  private_key = "cTncKFuKUWuNCu5vD9RJuvkPD6oStf7k3PaXwGLBZqEJURGXgMJX"
  ```

  Add the lines with the new address and the corresponding private key for it. If the
  public key of the node is not changed, you must use the old key for the new address.
  Otherwise use a new key. After modifying the configuration file you need to
  restart the node for the changes to take effect.

***Note!** If the transferring transaction has been lost, you need to establish a
new anchoring chain by a new funding transaction.*
