//! # Introduction
//!
//! Private blockchain infrastructure necessitates additional measures for
//! accountability of the blockchain validators.
//! In public proof of work blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin), accountability is purely economic and is
//! based on game theory and equivocation or retroactive modifications being economically costly.
//! Not so in private blockchains, where these two behaviors
//! are a real threat per any realistic threat model that assumes
//! that the blockchain is of use not only to the system validators,
//! but also to third parties.
//!
//! This crate implements a protocol for blockchain anchoring onto the Bitcoin blockchain
//! that utilizes the native Bitcoin capabilities of creating multisig([p2sh][1]) transactions.
//! This transactions contains metadata from Exonum blockchain (block's hash on corresponding
//! height) and forms a chain.
//!
//! You can read the details in [specification][2].

//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Create application with anchoring service
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use exonum_cli::NodeBuilder;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), failure::Error> {
//!     exonum::helpers::init_logger()?;
//!     NodeBuilder::new()
//!         .with_rust_service(exonum_btc_anchoring::BtcAnchoringService)
//!         .run()
//! }
//! ```
//!
